## Problem definition
We’ve developed a website that can be used to carry out various tasks which goes under managing a department. Also, the website must be able to control all the activities for a particular department, in our case, the Computer Science Department. To handle all these tasks, the website must be divided into multiple sections and must also have an admin section, which should help in maintaining the data to be displayed on the website.

## Project Purpose or Objectives
The primary objective of the Department Website is to provide up-to-date information to students and staff. A College website provides information related to the whole college, but a department website aims at providing streamlined information about only the particular department. The following features are key to our project:
•	Instantaneous information about events taking place in the department
•	Information about faculty and their contact information
•	News about workshops, fests, and celebrations that are presently being conducted
•	Provision of timetable for particular semester and class
•	Alumni portal to register and get info about passed out students

## Applications
Department website can be used either by students or staff or aspirants who would like to register themselves in a course offered by the department. Also, it can be used to spread word about events taking place in and around the department. It can also be used to get contact information of a particular faculty.
